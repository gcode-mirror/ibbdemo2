# Introduction #

Built using the powerful Adobe Air, Flex and Flash platforms, iBBDemo2 is a no frills, cross platform desktop application that can be used to test Web applications and Web sites to get fairly accurate approximation of how they would function on iPad and iPhone devices.  It can also be useful if you are doing a presentation on a non-Apple machine and need to demo HTML Web Apps and Sites that target the iPad. Some key features, including appropriate user agent emulation by device, hot key switching between both devices and orientations, zoom support, toggle for Adobe Flash support in pages (ultimately I'd like to get Android support in here too), auto page scale in iPad portrait mode and more!  Note it is not a perfect simulation, but in general by using the WebKit engine you'll get a decent approximation.  It can be quite useful if you need to do a presentation on a Windows or Linux machine, demonstrating iPad and iPhone Web apps and sites as well.

# Building the Source #

iBBDemo2 was built as an Air application using the Flash Builder 4 IDE.  You'll need to import the source into a project in FlashBuilder 4. The Adobe Air 2 SDK and runtime is required as well.
